          <h1>QUETTA</h1>
          <p>Quetta (/ˈkwɛtə/; Urdu: کوئٹہ, ko'eṭa, [ˈkweːʈə] , Pashto: کوټه) is the capital and largest city of the Pakistani province of Balochistan. It is the tenth largest city in Pakistan, with a population of over 1.6 million.[4] It is situated in the south-west of the country, lying in a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides. Quetta is at an average elevation of 1,680 metres (5,510 feet) above sea level,[5] making it Pakistan's highest altitude major city. The city is known as the "Fruit Garden of Pakistan" due to the numerous fruit orchards in and around it and the large variety of fresh and dried fruits produced there.[6]</p>
          <p>Located in northern Balochistan near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and the road across to Kandahar, Quetta is a trade and communication centre between the two countries.[7] The city is near the Bolan Pass, which was on a major gateway from Central Asia to South Asia.</p>
          <h1>Etymology</h1>
          <p>The name Quetta is a variation of the Pashto word Kwatkōṭ, or kōta meaning "fortress".[8] Quetta was formerly known as Shalkot (Pashto: ښالکوټ)[9]</p>
          <h1>Early history</h1>
          <p>Modern day Quetta was captured by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi during his invasion of South Asia.[10] In 1543, Mughal emperor Humayun came to Quetta en route to Safavid Persia, leaving his son and future Mughal emperor Akbar here. In 1709, the region was a part of Afghan Hotak dynasty and stayed a part until 1747 when Ahmed Shah Durrani conquered it and made it a part of Durrani Empire. The first European visited Quetta in 1828, describing it as mud-walled fort surrounded by three hundred mud houses.[11]</p>
          <h1>Foundation</h1>
          <p>In 1876, Quetta was occupied by the British and subsequently incorporated into British India.[10] In 1856, British General John Jacob had urged his government to occupy Quetta given its strategic position on the western frontier.[12] British troops constructed the infrastructure for their establishment as a garrison town.[13]</p>
          <p>It was reconstructed after the 1935 Quetta earthquake, which razed the city to the ground. The epicentre of the earthquake was close to the city and destroyed most of the city's infrastructure, killing an estimated 40,000 people.[14] After the foundation of Pakistan, Balochistan acquired the status of a province and Quetta became a provincial capital.[10]</p>
